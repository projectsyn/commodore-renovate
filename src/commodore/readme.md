# Commodore manager

Extracts all Commodore components from the configuration hierarchy.

By default, the manager searches for any files ending with `.yml` or `.yaml`.
It will try to parse each file and will ignore files which cannot be parsed.

To infer component URLs for Commodore component version pins (that is, entries in `parameters.components` which only have field `version`), the manager calls `commodore inventory components` with appropriate configurations.
See section "Configuration" for ways to configure how the inputs of the `commodore inventory components` call are generated by the manager.

## Configuration

The Commodore manager requires some non-standard configurations.
Since it's not trivial to add additional configuration options directly in `renovate.json`, the manager only has one non-standard config option in `renovate.json`.
This config option is called `extraConfig` and is expected to point to another json file in the repository which contains the manager config.

The manager currently understands the following keys in the extra configuration file:

- `extraParameters`: Extra parameters which are provided to Commodore when rendering the repository hierarchy with `commodore inventory components`.

- `distributionRegex`: A regex pattern which is used to extract the distribution (and optionally cloud) name from a file name.
  The manager expects that this regex pattern has a named capture group `distribution` which corresponds to the K8s distribution name as used in the hierarchy.
  The manager will also use a named capture group `cloud` as the cloud provider name, if it exists.

  Default: `/^distribution\/(?<distribution>[^\/]+)(?:\/cloud\/(?<cloud>.+)\.ya?ml|(?:\/.+)?\.ya?ml)$/`.

  The default regex pattern extracts the distribution (and optionally cloud) name from file names in the following forms (and additionally the same forms with `.yaml` files extensions):

  - `distribution/<distribution>.yml`
  - `distribution/<distribution>/file.yml`
  - `distribution/<distribution>/cloud/<cloud>.yml`

- `cloudRegionRegex`: A regex pattern which is used to extract the cloud provider and cloud region name from a file name.
  The manager expects that this regex pattern has a named capture group `cloud` which corresponds to the cloud provider name as used in the hierarchy.
  The manager will also use a named capture group `region` as the cloud provider region, if it exists.

  Default: `/^cloud\/(?<cloud>[^\/]+)(?:\/(?<region>.+)\.ya?ml|\.ya?ml)$/`.

  The default regex pattern extracts the cloud (and optionally cloud region) name from file names in the following forms (and additionally the same forms with `.yaml` files extensions):

  - `cloud/<cloud>.yml`
  - `cloud/<cloud>/<region>.yml`

- `ignoreValues`: An array of strings to ignore if they appear as distribution, cloud or region values.
  The manager will not use distribution, cloud, or region values which match an entry in this array when calling `commodore inventory components`.

  Default: `['params']`.
